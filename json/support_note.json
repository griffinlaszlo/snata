I am most known for skiing being the most followed winter sport athlete on TikTok.  This season, I plan on posting a lot of my content on Snapchat and I am working on establishing myself on this platform as a creator.  Many of my friends that are influencers have recently had the yellow star added to their profile, recognizing them as a creator.  I was wondering how I can achieve this.  I am also one of Chipotle's social media creators, and I am sponsored by a variety of different ski equipment companies.  You can check out my socials @griffinlaszlo.  It is my understanding that Snapchat is working hard to be more of a platform for creators, and I would love to actively contribute towards that.  Let me know if there is anything else I can do!! I look forward to your reply."}],"In-app Report":[],"Shake to Report":[]}
